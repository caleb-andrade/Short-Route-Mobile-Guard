# Short-Route-Mobile-Guard
Computing a short route for a mobile guard, Stony Brook University 2015 I developed a heuristic algorithm to solve a computational geometry problem in which a mobile guard moves along a map consisting of an arrangement of orthogonal line segments. The objective is to guard the map with the shortest route.
